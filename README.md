#### 1.0 Introduction

> A hotel reservation system is a necessity for today’s accommodation providers as the reservation system enables users to book a hotel room with a cohesive system where it allows users to navigate the system by adding, filling and searching a hotel and the room based on their preferences. As well, it allows the users to book the hotel room online and the system encompasses the hotel’s availability resources such as Wifi, Pools and Breakfast. Furthermore, the system provides multiple pictures for each hotel room. Other than that, it validates the users to schedule dates and length of stay. Our system depicts a hotel consisting of a variety of rooms offering guests extraordinary experiences, created by combining unique architecture and structure, expressive decor and artistry, and magnificent features. Yet, this hotel provides rooms with best prices based on customers personal preferences to maintain and enhance customers' experiences.
